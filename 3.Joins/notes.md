# 3. Joins

`JOIN` clauses are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Mastering joins is arguably the most important practical SQL skill for working with relational data.

## Types of Joins

The most common types of joins can be visualized using Venn diagrams. Imagine the left circle is `Table A` and the right circle is `Table B`. The shaded area represents the data that is returned.



### `INNER JOIN`
Returns records that have matching values in **both** tables. It's the intersection of the two tables.

### `LEFT JOIN` (or `LEFT OUTER JOIN`)
Returns **all** records from the left table (`Table A`), and the matched records from the right table (`Table B`). If there is no match, the columns from the right table will be `NULL`.

### `RIGHT JOIN` (or `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`)
Returns **all** records from the right table (`Table B`), and the matched records from the left table (`Table A`). It's the opposite of a `LEFT JOIN`.

### `FULL OUTER JOIN`
Returns all records when there is a match in **either** the left or the right table. It essentially combines the results of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`.

### `SELF JOIN`
This isn't a different type of join, but a regular join where a table is joined with itself. It's used to query hierarchical data or compare rows within the same table.

### `CROSS JOIN`
Returns the Cartesian product of the two tablesâ€”every row from the first table is combined with every row from the second. This is rarely used and can produce massive result sets.

## Practical SQL Example

We will use the `employees` and `departments` tables from the previous section. First, let's add some data to better illustrate the joins.

```sql
-- Add a new department that has no employees yet
INSERT INTO departments (dept_id, dept_name) VALUES (4, 'Marketing');

-- Add a new employee who is not yet assigned to a department
INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, first_name, last_name, email, salary, dept_id) VALUES
(104, 'Diana', 'Miller', 'diana.m@example.com', 72000, NULL);
```

### 1. INNER JOIN Example
Returns only employees who are assigned to a department. `Diana` (no department) and `Marketing` (no employees) are excluded.

```sql
SELECT
    e.first_name,
    d.dept_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

### 2. LEFT JOIN Example
Returns **all employees**, even if they don't have a department. `Diana` is included, but her `dept_name` is `NULL`.

```sql
SELECT
    e.first_name,
    d.dept_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

### 3. RIGHT JOIN Example
Returns **all departments**, even if they have no employees. `Marketing` is included, but its `first_name` is `NULL`.

```sql
SELECT
    e.first_name,
    d.dept_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

### 4. FULL OUTER JOIN Example
Returns **all employees and all departments**. Both `Diana` and `Marketing` are included in the result set with `NULL`s where there is no match.

```sql
SELECT
    e.first_name,
    d.dept_name
FROM employees e
FULL OUTER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

### 5. SELF JOIN Example
To show this, we need a manager for each employee. Let's add a `manager_id` column that refers back to the `emp_id`.

```sql
-- First, add the column
ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN manager_id INT;

-- Now, assign managers
UPDATE employees SET manager_id = 101 WHERE emp_id = 102; -- Alice manages Bob
UPDATE employees SET manager_id = 101 WHERE emp_id = 103; -- Alice manages Charlie

-- This query finds the manager's name for each employee
SELECT
    e.first_name AS employee_name,
    m.first_name AS manager_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.emp_id; -- Join the table to itself
```

### ðŸ’¡ Key Interview Takeaways

* **`INNER JOIN` vs. `LEFT JOIN`:** This is the most common question about joins.
    * **`INNER JOIN`** is for when you only want records where a relationship **exists**.
    * **`LEFT JOIN`** is for when you want all records from the primary (left) table, regardless of whether a relationship exists. A key use case is finding things that *haven't* happened (e.g., find all customers who have **never** placed an order by using a `LEFT JOIN` from `customers` to `orders` and filtering `WHERE orders.id IS NULL`).
* **Hierarchical Data:** When you hear about querying hierarchical data (like org charts, categories and sub-categories), your first thought should be **`SELF JOIN`**.

### Common Interview Questions

1.  **Explain the difference between an `INNER JOIN` and a `LEFT JOIN`.**
    * *Answer:* An `INNER JOIN` returns only the rows where the join condition is met in both tables. A `LEFT JOIN` returns all rows from the left table, and for rows that have no match in the right table, it returns `NULL` for the right table's columns.
2.  **When would you use a `SELF JOIN`? Provide a practical example.**
    * *Answer:* You use a `SELF JOIN` for querying hierarchical data within the same table. A classic example is an `employees` table where each employee has a `manager_id` that points to another employee's `id`. You would self-join to get the employee's name and their manager's name in the same row.
